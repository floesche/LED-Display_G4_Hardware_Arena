## Summary

This is a prototype for higher voltages and voltage stabilization at the comm board level. This version for the Teensy is therefore similar to the v7 for the NI board. We produced some prototypes, which are not electrically compatible with the rest of the G4 ecosystem, and then returned to the idea of providing the same electrical interface. Check out v10, if you want to actually build a working system.


## Notes

panel header pin distance from front

D = PCB + HDR1 + HDR2 - 0.5*HDR3

where

PCB  = thickness of PCB (1.6mm)
HDR1 = distance from PCB to top of insulation for 2x2 headers on driver (3.81mm)
HDR2 = distance from PCB to top of insulation for 2x2 headers on comm (8.5mm)
HDR3 = distance from PCB to pin in 15-pos header on comm (0.5*2.54mm)


D = 1.6 + 3.81 + 8.5 + 0.5*2.54 = 12.01mm
